                <p>Our goal is to build an engaging platform for hackers to solve interesting real world challenges in all domains of Computer Science.</p>
                <p>We have had a dedicated, core group of users since we launched in beta. We're hiring a Product Hacker to focus on two important metrics - Engagement (time spent and interaction) and Retention (churn factor). We listen to our users a lot and been doing a bunch of experiments on our site - bot-vs-bot games, real-world challenges from companies, etc. which has made thousands of users happy. Imagine if you grew this number by 100x or 1000x? <a href = "http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460.html">Software is eating the world</a> and if all the world's problem solvers come together at a single place, it will be the most valuable place EVER built. We are looking for a Product Hacker to help us push features (or kill features) to reach the goal. The Product Hacker is the bridge between the user and the product and works with everyone in the team (designers, founders, engineers).</p>

                <p>For example, most of our AI challenges are interesting bot-vs-bot games (Anti Chess, Othello). You code a bot which plays with the rest of our system and determines the best AI. There’s scope to design this way for every type of challenge</p>
                <p>The other part of HackerRank is designing the platform itself - categorization of challenges, rewards and badges for accomplishments, a hacker profile that pulls information from HackerRank and other relevant sites, etc</p>
                <p>You’ll be interacting with a team of experienced hackers who understand what needs to be built and how</p>

                <p>HackerRank is building the most engaged community of hackers.</p>
                <p>The hypothesis: Every hacker has a category of challenges that they love, whether they are coding at their level or pushing their limits and learning something new.</p>
                <p>We're building a large collection of real world challenges in various domains of Computer Science like Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Distributed Systems, etc. The challenges themselves are sourced from top hackers, professors, and companies who work in that domain.</p>

                          <li>Auto scale codechecker instances and other parts of the infrastructure</li>
                          <li>Code components that can "try" to detect complexity of the code (we know it's NP), ensuring there's no bias towards a particular language</li>

        <div class="span4 careers-perk">
            <h4 class="careers_perks-title">All the Right Tools</h4>
            <p>We know that everyone's perfect workspace is unique to them. We will get you set up with whatever equipment you need to start hacking - a new 15&rdquo; Macbook Pro or iMac, or a computer of your choice plus a display if you need it. Additionally, if you require any software or other tools, we've got it covered.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="span4 careers-perk">
            <h4 class="careers_perks-title">Flexible Hours</h4>
            <p>Because we work so hard, we encourage our employees to keep flexible hours and don't require them to track their time. A morning scrum and open communication ensures that the job gets done on time, and we rely on the honor system so that you can work on your own pace.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="span4 careers-perk">
            <h4 class="careers_perks-title">Location, Location, Location</h4>
            <p>We are the first Indian company to be backed by Y-Combinator, and as a result we have a thriving office in Bangalore and a growing office in Mountain View, CA. Depending on your residency or visa status, we will get you situated in one of our two offices, both of which are located in the heart of their country's tech industry.</p>

        <div class="span4 careers-perk">
            <h4 class="careers_perks-title">Wellness Support</h4>
            <p>To work hard, you have to be healthy. We will cover your health, dental, and visual insurance with no wait period. That means instant benefits from the day you're hired.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="span4 careers-perk">
            <h4 class="careers_perks-title">Creative Support</h4>
            <p>If you have a cool side project that you want to launch, we will pay for EC2/heroku servers to get it off the ground. Side projects fuel creativity and learning, which are crucial to the HackerRank culture.</p>

<section class="container content-text careers_culture">
    <div class="padded">
        <h3 class="careers_header">Company Culture</h3>
        <p>The culture of a startup is reflective of the founders’ DNA. Larry Page & Sergey Brin were PhD’s from Stanford and that’s why Google is filled with high scoring graders from top schools and is very hard to get in if you’re not a CS major. Similarly, the hacker culture at Facebook is inspired by Zuckerberg, a hacker, the design culture by Steve Jobs and so on.</p>
        <p>The adjective to describe the environment/founders here is relentless hardworkers. It might be a general trait of a startup but I’m pretty sure it’s a notch higher here and defines the culture. This is what has taken us this far. It’s not working in weekends or allnighters that count, but the effort that goes into building something intellectually engaging for hackers and making it fun is high.</p>
        <p>You’ll have to embrace randomness and chaos. There’s some level of discipline (eg: daily scrums) but only so much. We push boundaries everyday, stretch our limits but no one complains because there’s a feeling of doing something great at the end of the day, every single day.</p>
