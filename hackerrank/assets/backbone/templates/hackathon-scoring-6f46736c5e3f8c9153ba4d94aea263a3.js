The shorter your code is, the higher you will score. The specific scoring details will be given in the challenge statement.</p>\n            </section>\n            <section id="algorithmic-challenges">\n                <h3>Algorithmic Challenges</h3>\n                <p>The algorithmic challenges come with test cases which are increasingly difficult to pass. </p>\n                <p>The score will be based on the percentage of tests cases which your code passes. For example, if you pass 5 out of 10 tests cases, you will receive the points allotted for those 5 passed test cases of that challenge.
