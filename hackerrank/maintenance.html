                <p class="title">Interesting puzzle</p>
                <p>There are 2n balls labeled from 1 to 2n. The balls are distributed equally between two identical boxes. We know that each box contains n balls, but don't know which ball is in which box. We wish to learn the grouping of the balls by asking questions of the form "Is ball i and ball j in the same box?".</p>

                <p>For example, if n=3 we can learn the grouping by asking four questions: for 2&#x2264;j&#x2264;5 ask "Is ball 1 and ball j in the same box?". It is easy to see that, in general, we can learn the grouping in 2n-2 questions.</p>
                <p>Can you do better than that?</p>
